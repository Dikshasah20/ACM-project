        <h3>ARTICLE I: ACM</h3>
        <br>
            <p></h3><br>
            
              ACM stands for the Association for Computing Machinery. It is a professional organization that focuses on computing as a science and a profession. ACM was founded in 1947 and is one of the world's largest and most prestigious computing societies.

              ACM provides a platform for computer scientists, researchers, and professionals to exchange ideas, share research findings, and stay updated on the latest developments in the field of computing. The organization publishes numerous journals, magazines, and conference proceedings covering a wide range of topics within computer science.
              
            </p><br>
        <h3>ARTICLE II: MEMBERSHIP</h3><br>
            <p>

        <h3>ARTICLE III: OFFICERS</h3>    <br>
            <p>
                The officers of this Chapter shall be: Chair, Vice Chair, and
                Treasurer. These individuals must be ACM Student Members. In addition,
                a Faculty Sponsor with an ACM Professional Membership is required.
                These officers constitute the Council. A minimum of three officers to
                establish a Chapter. Other officers may also be established. All
                required officers of the Chapter must be members of ACM. The officers
                shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual
                election meeting. They shall take office on January / 25 and serve for
                one year. [It is highly recommended that the Chapterâ€™s election be
                held at the last meeting in the fall with the new officers taking
                office in January. This provides for a period of transition from the
                outgoing Council to the incoming Council as well as providing
                continuity of management and planning over the summer. If your school
                operates on a quarter or trimester system, choose a timing that serves
                the same objectives. Appointment or nomination of an individual to an
                officer position within an ACM chapter shall be in general limited to
                two full consecutive terms in the same position. This recommendation
                is intended to encourage the continuing infusion of new volunteers
                into the organization and to encourage office holders to give thought
                to planning for their successor. Appointment or nomination to a third
                or subsequent consecutive term should be limited to situations where
                such appointment or nomination is believed to be in the best interests
                of the Association.

        <p>
            
          An ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter sponsor is an individual or organization that provides support, guidance, and resources to an ACM student chapter at a particular academic institution. The sponsor plays a crucial role in fostering the growth and success of the ACM chapter by offering financial assistance, mentorship, and access to industry connections.

Here are some key aspects of an ACM chapter sponsor:

Financial Support: Sponsors often provide funding to help the ACM chapter organize events, conferences, workshops, and other activities. This financial support can cover expenses such as venue rentals, catering, promotional materials, and guest speaker fees.

Mentorship and Guidance: Sponsors may offer mentorship to the chapter members, helping them navigate their academic and professional journeys in the field of computing. This guidance can include advice on career paths, industry trends, and educational opportunities.

Resource Allocation: Sponsors may assist in obtaining resources such as software licenses, hardware, or other tools that are essential for the chapter's activities and projects.

Industry Connections: A sponsor can facilitate connections between the ACM chapter and industry professionals, creating opportunities for students to network, learn about job opportunities, and gain insights into the practical applications of computing.

Guest Speakers and Workshops: Sponsors may help coordinate guest speakers or experts to conduct workshops, seminars, or lectures for the ACM chapter. This enriches the educational experience for chapter members and exposes them to real-world perspectives.
